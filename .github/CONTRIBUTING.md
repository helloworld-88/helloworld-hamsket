## Submitting issues

* Please search the existing issues first, it's likely that your issue was already reported or even fixed.
  - Go to "Issues" and type any word in the top search/command bar.
  - Consider to search on closed issues. To do that just remove "is:open" from the search field.
  - More info on [search syntax within github](https://help.github.com/articles/searching-issues)
